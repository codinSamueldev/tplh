        <section id="common-questions">
            <header>Common questions</header>
            <p>
                After checking your tools, let's take something into account. It is required to do a research about the company you are applying for since you want to know the requirements for the position, dress code, values and its culture. Then, the neat section of the interview which is, how to ace questions? I will introduce you to the common ones.
            </p>
            <h3>Can you tell me about yourself?</h3>
            <p>
                The interviewer is looking for <i>professional</i> background, <i>strenghts</i> related of the position, <i>academic</i> background, <i>goals</i> you want to achieve in the position and <i>confidence</i>. Let me share with you a script you can take advantage of (Remember to paraphrase it according to your position).
            </p>
            <div>
                <p class="script">
                    I am a <b>(Professional role)</b> Some of my strengths are <b>(Mention minimum three strengths that are aligned with the role)</b> I studied/I'm studying <b>(Specialized knowledge & education)</b> I recently worked as a <b>(position and company)</b> Where I <b>(List of duties, obligations or responsibilities)</b> Now I am looking for <b>(Goal).</b>
                </p>
                <center>
                    <q>
                        <b>I am a highly qualified professional with a Degree in Business Administration</b> and over five years of experience in the areas of sales, management, accounting and marketing within different industries. <b>Some strengths I have developed are</b> my excellent communication skills, attention to detail, teamwork, problem solving skills and being innovative especially in sales strategies. Since I am completely bilingual, I am able to communicate effectively with people from different countries. <b>Now I am looking for</b> a new challenge as an international sales manager. I would like to <b>contribute with my qualification and experience in order to reach company goals.</b>
                    </q>
                </center>
                <cite>Source: Platzi.</cite>
            </div>
            <h3>Why should we hire you?</h3>
            <p>
                Highlight what you like about the company and why you would be a good fit, select the accurate words to sound confident of your skill-set, nor egocentric, nor immature. Lastly, focus on the value you will bring.
            </p>
            <div>
                <center>
                    <q>
                        I admire your company's results in the industry and I have experience in the services your company provides. <b>I am goal-oriented and I deliver exceptional results</b>, such as improving sales by 80%, and implementing a strategy to lower costs while maintaining quality. Since I have worked with people from different countries <b>I adapt easily and work well with other people</b>. I am sure <b>I would be a good match for this position</b>. I am interested in international sales and I am committed to creating innovative strategies to achieve company goals.
                    </q>
                </center>
            </div>
            <h3>What do you consider are the most important aspects in (position)?</h3>
            <p>
                A great question to show your capacities and skills, right? So bear this in mind, when you get asked in that kind of question mention <b>two</b> or <b>three</b> aspects. Also, you can give a wide example, hypothetical situations or how did you applied/how can you apply those aspects.
            </p>
            <div>
                <center>
                    <q>
                        The first aspect that I consider to be really important is patience. As a customer service agent, we have to control our emotions and deal with angry customers all the time. That is why we must be able to remain calm even when we want to punch someone. The second aspect is organization. We are going to be dealing with a lot of information at the same time, so it's important not to get confused with personal information such as names, phone numbers, ID numbers, addresses, among other information.
                    </q>
                </center>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section id="ask">
            <header>Don't forget to ask</header>
            <p>
                Now, we are in the final section of the interview and you already killed it! Therefore, we want to get reminded as a good candidate, so, in order to make this happen is asking further information about the company and position. As we read before, it is important to do a research about the company, consequently, we may have those first questions we want to get answered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are three great ones:
                <ol>
                    <li>Usually, how is a day as a (position)?</li>
                    <li>What's the most important thing I should accomplish in the first 90 days?</li>
                    <li>What are the biggest challenges that I might face in this position?</li>
