                After checking your tools, let's take something into account. It is required to do a research about the company you are applying for since you want to know the requirements for the position, dress code, values and its culture. Then, the neat section of the interview which is, how to ace questions? I will introduce you to the common ones.
            </p>
            <h3>Can you tell me about yourself?</h3>
            <p>
                The interviewer is looking for <i>professional</i> background, <i>strenghts</i> related of the position, <i>academic</i> background, <i>goals</i> you want to achieve in the position and <i>confidence</i>. Let me share with you a script you can take advantage of (Remember to paraphrase it according to your position).
            </p>
            <div>
                <p class="script">
                    I am a <b>(Professional role)</b> Some of my strengths are <b>(Mention minimum three strengths that are aligned with the role)</b> I studied/I'm studying <b>(Specialized knowledge & education)</b> I recently worked as a <b>(position and company)</b> Where I <b>(List of duties, obligations or responsibilities)</b> Now I am looking for <b>(Goal).</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>"I am a highly qualified professional with a Degree in Business Administration</b> and over five years of experience in the areas of sales, management, accounting and marketing within different industries. <b>Some strengths I have developed are</b> my excellent communication skills, attention to detail, teamwork, problem solving skills and being innovative especially in sales strategies.

            </div>
            <h3>Why should we hire you?</h3>
            <p>
                Highlight what you like about the company and why you would be a good fit, select the accurate words to sound confident of your skill-set, nor egocentric, nor immature. Lastly, focus on the value you will bring.
            </p>
            <div>
                <p>
                    "I admire your company's results in the industry and I have experience in the services your company provides. <b>I am goal-oriented and I deliver exceptional results</b>, such as improving sales by 80%, and implementing a strategy to lower costs while maintaining quality.
